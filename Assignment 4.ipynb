    "    2. Use pre-trained word embeddings (like GloVe or Word2Vec) instead of training embeddings from scratch.\n",
    "3. Why does a simple RNN often underperform compared to LSTM or GRU on long text sequences such as IMDB reviews?\n",
    "    1. Simple RNNs suffer from learning long-range dependencies in long sequences. LSTMs and GRUs have gating mechanisms (forget, input, output gates) that allow them to better preserve and control information flow over long sequences.\n",
    "4. Why does the embedding layer improve performance compared to one-hot encoding?\n",
    "    1. Embedding layers learn dense, continuous vector representations that capture semantic relationships between words, while one-hot encoding creates sparse, high-dimensional vectors with no meaningful relationships between different words. Embeddings also have much lower dimensionality and can generalize better.\n",
    "5. If we switched to character-level input instead of word-level, what changes would we expect in performance and training time?\n",
    "    1. Character-level models would have longer sequences, increasing training time significantly. Performance might decrease initially due to the increased complexity of learning from characters. Though we may find use in niche cases in better performance on out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "6. How does vocabulary size influence model performance and generalization?\n",
    "Larger vocabulary sizes can capture more nuanced language but require more parameters and training data. Smaller vocabularies are more computationally efficient but may lose important semantic information. There's a trade-off - too small and you lose information, too large and you may overfit or require excessive resources.\n",
